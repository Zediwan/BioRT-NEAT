# BioRT-NEAT: Biologically Inspired Real-Time NEAT

Welcome to **BioRT-NEAT**, an innovative adaptation of the real-time NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (rtNEAT). BioRT-NEAT advances the traditional NEAT framework by introducing a continuous, survival-based evolutionary process without the constraints of lifetime timers.

## Vision

BioRT-NEAT aims to provide a dynamic and adaptive platform for evolving neural networks in real-time environments. Unlike standard rtNEAT, where networks are evaluated based on a fixed lifetime, BioRT-NEAT leverages the principles of natural selection, allowing networks to reproduce based on their ability to survive and collect energy in their environment. This results in a more natural and fluid evolution process, akin to ecological systems.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Evolution**: Entities evolve continuously in real-time, adapting to their environment without predefined generations.
- **Survival-Based Reproduction**: Networks reproduce by surviving and collecting energy, promoting a natural selection mechanism.
- **Dynamic Population**: The population constantly adapts, with high-fitness networks having more opportunities to reproduce, ensuring the evolution of more efficient solutions.
- **No Lifetime Timers**: Removes the traditional lifetime timer, allowing networks to exist and evolve as long as they are fit, creating a more organic evolutionary process.
- **Energy-Driven Adaptation**: Entities gather energy, which influences their reproductive success, mimicking ecological and biological energy dynamics.

## Use Cases

BioRT-NEAT is designed for researchers and developers interested in:

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Developing AI that can adapt in real-time to changing environments.
- **Robotics**: Creating autonomous robots that evolve their behavior based on environmental interactions.
- **Simulation**: Modeling ecological systems and studying evolutionary dynamics.
- **Game Development**: Implementing adaptive AI that enhances player experiences by evolving in response to gameplay.
